In this workshop series, using "memory objects" – photos from personal archives of one's family, chosen family, and/or historical records – as windows into ancestral moments, participants  employ digital tools to speculatively re-create the space – and the feeling – around the view visible in each photo. Inspired by the re-existencia work of Kazakh artists [Aisha Jandosova](https://instagram.com/towardsanidealplace) and [Aida Issakhankyzy](https://www.instagram.com/waqitjariqkenistik/), the YA literature of Linda Sue Park, and the speculative fiction of Octavia Butler’s Patternmaster series, we talk through different approaches to remembering and being in relationship with ancestral stories – through craft, through narrative, through sensory practices and through spatial reconstruction – and their meanings to those of us with minoritized or diasporic identities seeking re-connection or re-unification.

Using relational reconstruction techniques developed in the [Seeing Providence Chinatown project](/chinatown/), each participant builds a virtual 3D space of care, based on a photo of their choosing, within an environment hosted on [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/).

Ancestral Memory Enclaves is facilitated by Jeffrey Yoo Warren and was first presented as part of [CultureHub](https://www.culturehub.org/events/re-fest-ancestral-memory-enclaves)'s Re-Fest 2022 in partnership with [AS220](https://as220.org). [Brandi Kinard](https://brandikinard.com/) assisted in facilitating Workshop 2.
