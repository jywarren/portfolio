As Iâ€™ve been [making and using DIY microscopes for some years](/inks/2019-01-23-microscope/), I was curious to try taking an analog photograph of a microscopic sample. I have been testing a way to produce a cyanotype directly from a microscopic slide using a UV laser and a small lens, and have been able to produce small snapshots of cells and insect parts in just a few minutes. 

I think this would make a really unique printmaking technique, and if we set up 2-3 boxes it would make for a nice station at AS220 Drink and Ink.
