As Iâ€™ve been [making and using DIY microscopes for some years](/inks/2019-01-23-microscope/), I was curious to try taking an analog photograph of a microscopic sample. I have been testing a way to produce a cyanotype directly from a microscopic slide using a UV laser and a small lens, and have been able to produce small snapshots of cells and insect parts in just a few minutes. 

This type of microscopic photography requires no electronics and results in a print. It will be an interactive part of [AS220 Industries Drink and Ink](http://industries.as220.org/) event in May 2020, where I will be Artist in Residence.
