The Papercraft Spectrometer is a DIY kit which shifts the problem space of spectrometry into the realm of papercraft. I led the development of this kit as Director of Research at Public Lab, and an estimated 80,000 kits have been distributed around the world since it’s first version in 2012.

…centers the experience of being a newcomer

The kit was included as an insert in issue X of Make Magazine, was a finalist for the Designs of the Year 2014 at the Design Museum in London, and was featured in the December issue of the Economist in 2017.
