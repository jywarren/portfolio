In 2023, I looked in the stereograph collections of the Library of Congress as part of my [residency](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/seeing-lost-enclaves/), and suddenly found a photograph that I recognized -- of a group of Korean people shoveling together with a single shovel -- at Together Shovel. It was a much clearer image than what I'd seen in the past! And dated to 1904, to the construction of a post office.

I had started researching what I've been calling the Together Shovel over a year ago, building a replica from a series of old photos I'd found, and learning to collectively shovel with others at @movementeducationoutdoors. As a part of the [Bburi Roots](https://instagram.com/bburi_roots) collective show, I installed the reconstructed Together Shovel in the window of the AS220 Aborn Gallery in Providence, along with two other pieces which offer a glimpse into ancestral moments through virtual reconstructions. 

This new photograph included amazing moments like someone eating lunch in a partially completed hanok - offering a detailed glimpse into another deep interest of mine: traditional Korean joinery. And the delighted expression of the kid watching the shoveling is joyful to see.
