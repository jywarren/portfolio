In 2023, I looked in the stereograph collections of the Library of Congress as part of my [residency](https://libraryofcongress.github.
io/seeing-lost-enclaves/), and suddenly found a photograph that I recognized -- of a group of Korean people shoveling together with a single shovel -- at Together Shovel. It was a much clearer version of an image I'd seen in the past! And dated to 1904, to the construction of a post office.

I had started researching what I've been calling the Together Shovel in 2022, building a replica from old photos I'd found, and I began to attempt to collectively shovel with Asian Americans wherever I was able to. 

This new photograph included amazing moments like someone eating lunch in a partially completed hanok - offering a detailed glimpse into another deep interest of mine: traditional Korean joinery. And the delighted expression of the kid watching the shoveling is joyful to see.

This work is part of three different projects I'm part of - first, a RISCA Make Art grant for Ancestral Memory Enclaves, second, as part of the [BBuri Roots collective book and show](https://www.instagram.com/bburi_roots) at the AS220 Aborn Gallery, and as part of my 2023-24 residency at the Library of Congress.
