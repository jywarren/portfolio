_Seeing Providence Chinatown_ is a project using archival photography and maps to build an immersive digital 3D model of historic downtown Providence Chinatown. The process of reconstructing the neighborhoodâ€™s building exteriors and streets will weave together and interlink the relatively few images remaining of this once-vibrant enclave, of which almost no trace remains today.
