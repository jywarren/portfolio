I've done illustration as a part of my practice for my whole career, but in recent years I've been asked to do illustration work with and for others as well. 

The above drawing was made in collaboration with [Caroline Woolard](http://carolinewoolard.com/) in 2016 just after the US elections, and represents a range of works, ideas, and aspirations reflected in her work. It is entitled _Solidarity Economy_ and was exhibited at the Queens Museum in New York and [Art Center Nabi](http://www.nabi.or.kr/) in Seoul, Korea.

## Public Lab

In my time at Public Lab, I produced many of the drawings and illustrations featured on Public Lab gear, such as totes, stickers, t-shirts, and mugs.

The [Open Hardware Association](https://oshwa.org), of which I am a board member, invited me to develop an illustration for the Open Hardware Certification program, and the following was unveiled at the Open Hardware Summit in 2019.

The [Design Studio for Social Intervention](http://ds4si.org) asked me to contribute the following drawing for one of their Social Emergency Response Center events in 2019.
