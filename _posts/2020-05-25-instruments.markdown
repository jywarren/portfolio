In early 2020, I’ve begun a collection of projects which prototype culturally situated knowledge production in a world where dominant culture collapses all meanings into one lineage (see [Anti-Assimilation](/themes)).

Each instrument explores ways of listening, knowing, and “tuning into” that build on non-eurocentric, non-masculine histories, and so may not speak to all audiences. These are not scientific instruments, but they do help people produce knowledge. 

Exploring or examining - those are scientific or even colonial terms. Categorizing, analyzing, “learning the science behind” something.

Instead these instruments invite intimacy with hidden landscapes, or shared secrets hiding in plain sight -- like a fourth color, or an untranslatable word. 

### Projects

As these projects progress, I’ll continue posting here with more about each instrument:

* **Porcelain spectrometer** - the [first in the collection](/2018/06/19/porcelain-spectrometer/), this exploration of a possible past imagines an artifact of an alternative origin story, a spectrometer in the tradition of Joseon period Korean inkwells.
* **Air lantern + kite** - coming soon
* **1000周 / 1000hz egg** - coming soon
