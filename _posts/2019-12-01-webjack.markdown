The Papercraft Spectrometer is a DIY kit which shifts the problem space of spectrometry into the realm of papercraft. I led the development of this kit as Director of Research at [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/), and an estimated 80,000 kits have been distributed around the world since it's first version in 2012.

...centers the experience of being a newcomer 

The kit was included as an insert in issue X of Make Magazine, was a finalist for the Designs of the Year 2014 at the Design Museum in London, and was featured in the December issue of the Economist in 2017.
