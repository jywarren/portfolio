Infragram is a DIY project to modify digital cameras to take infrared photos, in order to understand plant health. Using https://infragram.org, photos taken with an Infragram camera can be processed to highlight photosynthetic productivity. 

I led the development of this kit as Director of Research at [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/), and thousands of Infragram kits have been distributed around the world since it's first version in 2013.

The kit was featured in Popular Mechanics, and issue 70 of Make Magazine in 2019.
