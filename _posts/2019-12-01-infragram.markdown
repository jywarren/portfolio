Infragram camera kits are a low-cost, DIY project for analyzing plant health using mixed infrared/visible photography, based on a technique from satellite photography.

I led the development of this kit as Director of Research at [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/), and an estimated XXXX kits have been distributed around the world since it's first version in 2013.

The kit was featured in Popular Mechanics, and issue 70 of Make Magazine in 2019.
