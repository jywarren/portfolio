        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Papercraft Spectrometer is a DIY kit which shifts the problem space of spectrometry into the realm of papercraft. I led the development of this kit as Director of Research at &lt;a href=&quot;https://publiclab.org/&quot;&gt;Public Lab&lt;/a&gt;, and an estimated 80,000 kits have been distributed around the world since it’s first version in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…centers the experience of being a newcomer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kit was included as an insert in issue X of Make Magazine, was a finalist for the Designs of the Year 2014 at the Design Museum in London, and was featured in the December issue of the Economist in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Request a workshop&lt;/p&gt;
