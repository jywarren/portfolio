# Eastern Taiwan, 1990s

_[Dri Chiu Tattersfield](http://hellodri.itch.io/)_

I have very few photos of my mom from before I was born. This is one of the earliest ones I've been able to find - she's somewhere on the side of a mountain highway in eastern Taiwan, smiling in front of the view. I only have this narrow cutout, but was able to expand it into a 3D audio-visual space and imagine being there with her.
