# Phosphorite Mine Site of Buddha Mountain, Kunming, 2019

Yutong Lin

During a trip to visit my great-grandfather’s grave, the family decided to pass by the phosphorite factories where my great-uncle and aunt used to work, near the city of Kunming, in southwest China. It was now semi-abandoned after the failure of the third front plan, which had targeted imaginary wars against the US and Taiwan. During the 60s and 70s, military and ammunition factories, secretive army bases, and air-raid shelter bunks were widely built in the mountainous southwest and west China, newly built immigrant army towns and places were named in coded serial numbers, for a long-time remained unknown and a  national top secret. My family was largely influenced by this national plan. They have worked in remote regions in forestry, mining, and education, each of them had a tremendous experience like no other, some are glories of the family that we as kids have heard over and over, and some became wounds that we learned to never talk about… 

It was nearly 10 years later when my family visited the place they used to work, they posed in front of the house they had lived in more than a decade ago, smiling in front of it. Not far away from the remains of the falling house, there were few signs of people still living in the neighborhood, along with the giant slogans by Mao to promote the morale of the people.
