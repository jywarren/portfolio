# Busan, 1950s

_[Jasmine Hwang](https://www.jasminerhwang.com/)_

I had the pleasure of participating in the creation of the memory enclaves, which were inspired by my family heirloom, a najeon-chilgi (나전칠기) or Jagae (자개) jewelry box passed down from my grandmother. The intricate lacquerware inlaid with mother-of-pearl and shellfish pieces served as a source of comfort during moments of homesickness, reminding me of my hometown in Korea. For the memory enclaves exhibition, I recreated this space with photos of my parents and grandparents, encapsulating various ancestral memories within the confines of the jewelry box.

To access and experience the portal space we created a mask that became a memory portal, I crafted a mask inspired by traditional ceremonial headwear, the Samo (사모), using cardboard and adorned it with the colorful Korean snack wrapper, Jokduri (족두리). I hope visitors to the exhibition will feel a sense of connection and appreciation for the cultural elements incorporated into the memory enclaves.
