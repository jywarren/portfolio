# Beach, Korea, 1970s

_[Soyoung L Kim](http://www.soyounglkim.com/)_

I have always loved the ocean and this photo is a record of one of the earliest memories I have of going to the beach with my family. The process of creating an immersive space with the photos was really meaningful to me.

I made a mask of the face of a siren, who always calls me back to the water.
