# Ancestral Memory Enclaves

<div class="intro">

In this workshop series, using "memory objects" – photos from personal archives of one's family, chosen family, and/or historical records – as windows into ancestral moments, participants  employ digital tools to speculatively re-create the space – and the feeling – around the view visible in each photo. Inspired by the re-existencia work of Kazakh artists [Aisha Jandosova](https://instagram.com/towardsanidealplace) and [Aida Issakhankyzy](https://www.instagram.com/waqitjariqkenistik/), the YA literature of Linda Sue Park, and the speculative fiction of Octavia Butler’s Patternmaster series, we talk through different approaches to remembering and being in relationship with ancestral stories – through craft, through narrative, through sensory practices and through spatial reconstruction – and their meanings to those of us with minoritized or diasporic identities seeking re-connection or re-unification.
